ðŸ“š NextRead Project: Book Recommender System

The NextRead Project is a book recommendation system built using Python. It uses content-based filtering to suggest meaningful book recommendations based on the title you input. The project is hosted on Streamlit, providing an interactive web-based interface for users to easily explore book recommendations.

The recommender analyzes metadata such as genres, descriptions, and tags to find similarities between books, making personalized book suggestions tailored to your interests.

Features
 - Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books based on similarities in content, such as genres, tags, and descriptions.
 - Streamlit Interface: An intuitive and user-friendly web interface that allows users to input book titles and instantly receive recommendations.
 - Large Dataset: Utilizes a dataset from Goodreads containing thousands of books, tags, and ratings.

How It Works
 - Input: Users input the title of a book they enjoyed.
 - Processing: The recommender system searches the dataset and computes similarity scores between the input book and other books using content-based filtering techniques.
 - Output: A list of books similar to the input title is displayed along book covers.

Dataset
The project uses the Goodreads Dataset to build the recommendation engine. The dataset includes:

 - Books with metadata like title, genre, and description
 - Tags and user ratings
 - User interaction data such as reading history and preferences

Technologies Used
 - Python: The core logic is written in Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
 - Streamlit: A web app framework used to create the user interface.
 - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
 - scikit-learn: Used for building the content-based filtering recommendation system.
